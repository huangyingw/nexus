## What to Post

**On-Topic**: Anything that good hackers, startup founders, or scientists would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: **anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity**.

**Off-Topic**: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, unless they're evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.

**Strive to offer value**, but don't feel the pressure to write a long and complex article. Links with brief descriptions or microblogging-style posts are fine.

# In Discussion

Be civil. Don't say things you wouldn't say in a face-to-face conversation. Avoid gratuitous negativity.

When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling names. E.g. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1 is 2, not 3."

Having an intelligent critical discussion is good, but please avoid empty naysaying, there's no wisdom in it.

Assume good intentions. If there are two interpretations of the post, and one of them seems stupid or offends you - choose the other.

Please avoid introducing classic flamewar topics unless you have something genuinely new to say about them.
