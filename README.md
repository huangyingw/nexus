Hey, Hacker News! I'm looking for beta users and feedback on this project. My goal is to build the perfect social network, the way it's supposed to be built - open source, decentralized, with high quality community and without any nonsense.
 

# Features

### Decentralized and GNU Social compatible

Hacker Tribe is running on Nexus - a federated, reddit-like social networking platform.

It is dockerized, so you can easily spin up your own instance [with a few easy commands], and it will be plugged into the decentralized network.


### Open Source

Nexus is open source, and written in Django. You can easily fork it and add your own features or modify it's design as you wish. You can also contribute to the project [here]!


### Optimized for high quality discussion.

The goal of this community is to share insightful ideas that gratify intellectual curiosity, to exchange advice and experience. Clever and motivated entrepreneurs and creators here. No low quality inane memes allowed.
