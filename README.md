# Features

### Decentralized and GNU Social compatible

You can easily spin up your own instance by following instructions [here]. Dockerized, few easy commands.

### Open Source

Contribute to the project here.

Want to improve something or need a feature? Open a github issue, or code it yourself. No need to wait for a corporation to decide to implement it. Want a custom design or disagree about how it should work? For the platofrm and modify it however you want. The code is simple and understandable python, html, scss, and jQuery.

### Optimized for high quality discussion.

The goal of this community is to share insightful ideas that gratify intellectual curiosity, to exchange advice and experience. Clever and motivated entrepreneurs and creators here. No low quality inane memes allowed.

### You're the customer, not the product.

My goal is to make a platform where you are the customer, not the product. To make it sustainable, I am going to charge a reasonable membership price($10/year).

That will allow me to pay for the servers and focus on improving the user experience and the quality of the platform, instead of compromising it with ads or creepily trying to manipulate your attention.

As a side benefit, this will keep community to only engaged users who derive value out of it, and prevent spam and fake accounts.

Remember, if you don't like the moderation or don't want to pay - you can always easily run your own instance!

### No Bullshit

- **No ads**  
You give me money, I pay for servers and work on improving the platform. That's it.
- **No manipulation**  
No sneaky attempts to monetize your attention or to sell you anything.
- **No obscure algorithms**  
  Simple, transparent, elegant, reddit-like discovery system, based on upvotes.  
  Read the code to the algorithm and understand exactly what's going on.
- **No-procrastination mode**  
  I'm not trying to waste your time by keeping you on the site as long as possible. Getting addicted to spending time here? Enable the no-procrastination mode that allows you to access the website for only 20 minutes every 3 hours.
- **Moderation**  
  Moderation is strict, but transparent, and consistent with the rules that are designed to be as open as possible while maintaining high quality of the discussion.<span id="screenshots"></span>
