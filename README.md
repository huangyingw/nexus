Hey, Hacker News! I'm looking for beta users and feedback on this project. My goal is to build the perfect social network, the way it's supposed to be built - open source, decentralized, with high quality community and without any nonsense.
 
<!-- 
The following post outlines my plan, intended features, whatever. Please share your ideas and criticism.
 
 Specific auestions:

 2. What is your criticism of this idea? Find the flaws, pick it apart.
 3. What are the best strategies for kick starting and maintaining high quality community.
 2. Other ideas and siggestions.
 2. so,ething something.
 
 You can find code is [here], still is very much work in progress.

# Features

### Decentralized and GNU Social compatible

You can easily spin up your own instance by following instructions [here]. Dockerized, few easy commands.

### Open Source

Contribute to the project here.

Want to improve something or need a feature? Open a github issue, or code it yourself. No need to wait for a corporation to decide to implement it. Want a custom design or disagree about how it should work? For the platofrm and modify it however you want. The code is simple and understandable python, html, scss, and jQuery.

### Your Data is yours
Export data.

### Optimized for high quality discussion.

The goal of this community is to share insightful ideas that gratify intellectual curiosity, to exchange advice and experience. Clever and motivated entrepreneurs and creators here. No low quality inane memes allowed.

### You're the customer, not the product.

My goal is to make a platform where you are the customer, not the product. To make it sustainable, I am going to charge a reasonable membership price($10/year).

That will allow me to pay for the servers and focus on improving the user experience and the quality of the platform, instead of compromising it with ads or creepily trying to manipulate your attention.

As a side benefit, this will keep community to only engaged users who derive value out of it, and prevent spam and fake accounts.

Remember, if you don't like the moderation or don't want to pay - you can always easily run your own instance!

### No Bullshit

- **No ads or manipulation**  
You give me money, I pay for servers and work on improving the platform. That's it. No sneaky attempts to monetize your attention or to sell you anything.
- **No obscure algorithms**  
  Simple, transparent, elegant, reddit-like discovery system, based on upvotes.  
  Read the code to the algorithm and understand exactly what's going on.
- **No lock in**  
If I make the decisions you don't like, take this project in the wrong direction, or just generally turn evil - you can always just download your data, fork the project, run it on your server, even launch a competing service!
- **No-procrastination mode**  
  I'm not trying to waste your time by keeping you on the site as long as possible. Getting addicted to spending time here? Enable the no-procrastination mode that allows you to access the website for only 20 minutes every 3 hours.
- **Moderation**  
  Moderation is strict, but transparent, and consistent with the rules that are designed to be as open as possible while maintaining high quality of the discussion.<span id="screenshots"></span>

# Future plans

- Developer API

- ActivityPub integration

- Moderation Tools

- Social Network for the General Audience 

If this project works successfully - I am going to launch a social network for more general audience. It will be launched on a separate domain, so that this community would stay laser-focused on hacking, startups, and other topics relevant to HN audience. This will prevent all the issues that arise when community grows too large, keeping the quality of the community high.

- Experiment with Revenue Sharing

Perhaps I will implement some sort of revenue sharing system where best authors are rewarded with the part of the revenue based on how much upvotes they reveice. How much that will be will probably depend on how viable this whole model is.
