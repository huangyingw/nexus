# Nexus
### Federated social network, Reddit for decentralized web

> (Currently in active development, launching soon!)

My goal is to build the perfect social network, the way it's supposed to be built - open source, decentralized, with high quality community and without any nonsense.

Imagine Reddit meets Twitter but for decentralized web, where anyone can easily create their own website that will be plugged into the network. 

# Features


### Decentralized and GNU Social compatible


It is dockerized, so you can easily spin up your own instance [with a few easy commands], and it will be plugged into the decentralized network.


### Open Source

Nexus is open source, and written in Django. You can easily fork it and add your own features or modify it's design as you wish.


### Optimized for high quality discussion.
