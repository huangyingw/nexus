# Nexus

<!-- 
### Federated social network, Reddit for decentralized web
-->

> (Currently in active development, launching soon!)

My goal is to build the perfect social network, the way it's supposed to be built - open source, elegant, simple, with high quality community and without any nonsense.

<!-- decentralized, -->

This project is my attempt to take the best elements from all the social networks and combine them into one awesome community platform for hackers.

<!-- 
Imagine Reddit meets Twitter but for decentralized web, where anyone can easily create their own website that will be plugged into the network.

# Features


### Decentralized and ActivityPub compatible


It is dockerized, so you can easily spin up your own instance [with a few easy commands], and it will be plugged into the decentralized network.


### Open Source

Nexus is open source, and written in Django. You can easily fork it and add your own features or modify it's design as you wish.


### Optimized for high quality discussion.
