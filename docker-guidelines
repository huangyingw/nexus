Steps:

Place your nexus files in a directory named nexus.

Now put all three files in the same directory as nexus directory.



Command to create docker image without docker-compose:

--> docker build -t himanshuverma09/nexus .

(You can use any name for image)

Command to run docker container without docker-compose:

--> docker run --name=nexus --detach=true --restart=always --publish=8001:8000 himanshuverma09/nexus:latest


Command to create docker image with docker-compose:

--> docker-compose up



Run this commands in same directory as these files.

Now I am able to answer your questions and resolve bugs in Dockerfile.
